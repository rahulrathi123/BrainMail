# BrainMail
This is a repository for the code used to make the chrome extension called: BrainMail. I developed the chrome extension at an internship from May 2018 - August 2018. Link to the extension (no longer active): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/brainmail/fdgfojifagignflnohmodckpllcopehb

Documentation: https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/smartmails-internship-project-documentation-d49e71ef32d7

Note: extension.js contains mainly boilerplate code from Gmail.js, my code starts at line 13400 onwards
